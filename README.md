The world is advancing rapidly, and so should the healthcare system. It’s easier to collect data, conduct research, and come up with several treatment options that have the potential of performing well but there is no appropriate way of recording the people of our country, their diseases, medications and putting them safe and secured for future use. We believe that it is important to bring advanced technology into play, but so are the small things that we need to do to contribute to big changes. Since childhood, we have seen our adults keeping a large number of files at home to protect our medical records for future use. Every person knows the value and importance of protecting these records. However, when it comes to how to protect & value them, we fall short of options. There are situations when prescriptions get misplaced, damaged, or lost. These missing results and reports could have provided efficient and effective medical solutions to patients by making it easy for the doctors to check their previous medical records and ease patients comfort by using the existing technologies and systematically implementing them.

## Description

### What are we building?

Medica is a platform that connects all the people of our country to the doctors they go to for consultation and safeguard all the tips, prescriptions & reports digitally for future use. 

Tierra is a portal for small businesses to connect with raw material providers and customers to upcycle as much materials as one can. Think of an invitation card vendor and a small business that makes handmade gifts. Now, think of a dress maker who has leftover cloth pieces that have no use. Now, there are small businesses who make beautiful hair bands out of torn clothes. A cherry on top is that some of them add a small zipper in the hair band which creates a place to keep money and other small things. Think of how many zippers from broken/torn purses can be put to use! All of these were just a few examples. Another initiative to recycle materials is thrifting, which means that people can sell items they no longer need. The platform will also accommodate thrifting solutions for people who are willing to buy reusable stuff in a good condition.

### What problems are we solving?

Since childhood, we have seen our adults keeping a large number of files at home to protect our medical records for future use. Every person knows the value and importance of protecting these records. However, when it comes to how to protect & value them, we fall short of options. There are situations when prescriptions get misplaced, damaged, or lost. These missing results and reports could have provided efficient and effective medical solutions to patients by making it easy for the doctors to check their previous medical records and ease patients comfort by using the existing technologies and systematically implementing them.

### Why does it matter?

Our solution to help our frontline workers is to provide them with clinical decision support and management tools to offer the best healthcare decisions is something that we all know about, it just has to be executed in a way that all of our efforts come together and make a bigger impact. Imagine going to the doctor for the treatment of diabetes and not taking your previous medical reports & prescriptions with you, because either you have misplaced them, or your child has used them in his art homework, or simply you have forgotten them at home. How odd would it be for a doctor to treat you without knowing your previous problems, solutions, side-effects and medicines? Now, think of the doctor having an app on his phone, by which he can scan the QR in your phone, or just simply type the Phone Number of yours, linked to your Aadhar Card, to get all your medical history. Now, your doctor has accurate test results in hand and details about your past & current medications. This would make the process much easier for the doctors to analyse the patient’s situation, and the doctor’s response would be much more reliable and perfect.

<!-- 1. The seller navigates to the site and uploads a video file.
2. The user selects and buys the raw material of his/her choice
3. Tierra contacts delivery services and ensures safe and hurdle free delivery.
4. Both User and Seller can track the product until it gets delivered.

## Project roadmap

The project currently does the following things.
<!-- 
- Buyer can buy product of its choice, and add the product to the cart do the payment and buy product.
- Seller can add products of his choice, and keep it for sale.
- Database in connected to the website using cloudant and cloud foundry. Auth feature is added to the website to maintain authenticity. -->

The website is almost functional with frontend components, and the database integration, schema, API endpoints and a few logistically critical features to be added in future. The scalability (hosting backend cloud service) could be increased on demand. For privacy issues and originality, we also plan to have mobile phone OTP auth integration even when a hospital tries to access data. This allows users to control who can look into their medical history. User experience and ease of use would be highly prioritized while in development.We will also be creating an organizational and financial structure once we launch the website. We would like to launch the beta version first to get the response and work on the feedback and surveys. Once we are live, we aim to expand our scope by trying to integrate as many high-end practices as possible.
