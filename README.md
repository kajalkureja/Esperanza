# Esperanza
There is no appropriate way of recording the medical histories of the people of our country and putting them safe and secured for future use. Prescriptions often get misplaced, damaged, or lost. Doctors could have provided efficient and effective medical solutions by making it easy for the doctors to check their previous medical records. The world is advancing rapidly, and so should the healthcare system. So, the technology, and its ability to save and secure tons of data can be put to a good use here.

## Description

### What are we building?

Medica is a platform whose main idea involves automating the traditional way of writing prescriptions by digitalising them and keeping a record of them so that patients can track them easily anytime & anywhere. The platform wonâ€™t just be limited to securing medical reports & prescriptions, the patients will also have the opportunity to use the platform for getting the correct information about their disease, the tests they can take, and the doctors nearby to which they can consult, which will surely help patients make the best decision. Our vision for this platform was to ensure that all people and communities in our country receive the basic health services they need, when and where they need them without facing financial hardship. 

### What problems are we solving?

Since childhood, we have seen our adults keeping a large number of files at home to protect our medical records for future use. Every person knows the value and importance of protecting these records. However, when it comes to how to protect & value them, we fall short of options. There are situations when prescriptions get misplaced, damaged, or lost. These missing results and reports could have provided efficient and effective medical solutions to patients by making it easy for the doctors to check their previous medical records and ease patients comfort by using the existing technologies and systematically implementing them.

### Why does it matter?

Our solution to help our frontline workers is to provide them with clinical decision support and management tools to offer the best healthcare decisions is something that we all know about, it just has to be executed in a way that all of our efforts come together and make a bigger impact. Imagine going to the doctor for the treatment of diabetes and not taking your previous medical reports & prescriptions with you, because either you have misplaced them, or your child has used them in his art homework, or simply you have forgotten them at home.

## Project roadmap

The website is almost functional with frontend components, and the database integration, schema, API endpoints and a few logistically critical features to be added in future. The scalability (hosting backend cloud service) could be increased on demand. For privacy issues and originality, we also plan to have mobile phone OTP auth integration even when a hospital tries to access data. This allows users to control who can look into their medical history. User experience and ease of use would be highly prioritized while in development.We will also be creating an organizational and financial structure once we launch the website. We would like to launch the beta version first to get the response and work on the feedback and surveys. Once we are live, we aim to expand our scope by trying to integrate as many high-end practices as possible.
